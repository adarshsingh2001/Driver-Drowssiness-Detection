# Driver-Drowssiness-Detection

 ========================================
 

This Project based on Deep Learning(CNN), Computer Vision and Image Preprocessing detects the drowsiness of a vehicle driver driving on road at night. There are a lots of people who fell asleep while driving. This Program connected to the pre-build car camera always keeps a check on the driverâ€™s eyes. Whenever the driver closes his/her eyes for prolonged period of 4-5 seconds, our program also connected with an alarm system plays the Alarm at loud volume, thus bringing the driver back to his consciousness.




# Requirements -


* OpenCV(cv2)
* Numpy
* Keras
* os



# How to run the program



1. Download the complete file in the zip format and extract it to your local machine.
2. Also extract the eyes.rar file to same loaction.
3. Run the Data Preprocessing file in your jupyter notebook(Make sure you installed all the required libraries).
4. Run the Training Model file in your jupyter notebook.(It will take some time to build the CNN network and train upon it.)
5. Finally run the Drowsiness Detection (webcam) in your jupyter notebook and allow your camera to take videos.
6. Enjoy the Program.
